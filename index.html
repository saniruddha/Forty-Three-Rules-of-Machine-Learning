Even organizations like Google have made mistakes in the past before leading the world in ways to implement and leverage the power of machine learning. They have shared their invaluable experience in the form of &lsquo;Forty Three Rules of Machine Learning&rsquo; to help others develop great machine learning solutions. We have carefully referred to the information shared by Google to develop a good machine learning solution for our project on &lsquo;Prediction of COVID-19 Cases&rsquo;.</span></p><h5 class="c6" id="h.vem0dqti8sqq"><span class="c5 c3">Before Machine Learning:</span></h5><ul class="c7 lst-kix_wn7o3q7nk2c0-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #1:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t be afraid to launch a product without machine learning.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We have carefully checked the usability of our dataset which consists of 500,000 records and 11 features. Therefore, using machine learning will give us a 100% boost in making predictions instead of a heuristic approach.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_61rf2gr8ovxl-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #2:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;First, Design and implement metrics.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We have come up with some strong metrics like &lsquo;impact of ship entering a particular state&rsquo;, &lsquo;impact on individual states&rsquo;, &lsquo;likelihood of spread in neighboring states&rsquo;, &lsquo;trend in increase in the number of cases&rsquo; after carefully assessing the data quality for making predictions. </span></p><h5 class="c6" id="h.eyhn2ju9ie5w"><span class="c5 c3">ML Phase I: Your First Pipeline:</span></h5><ul class="c7 lst-kix_jn3k4c1zxkwd-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #4:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We are working on a classic regression problem in our project i.e. predicting the number of confirmed Coronavirus cases on a given date. Therefore, we have decided to keep it simple at first by properly implementing a basic linear regression model on simple features to perform predictions and later extend it to a more complex ML model.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_roa54k3tq1ja-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #14:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Starting with an interpretable model makes debugging easier.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">As we have decided to start implementation with a linear regression model, which is directly motivated by a probabilistic model, it will be easy to inspect the production system and identify problems.</span></p><h5 class="c6" id="h.pbu3eq92jwil"><span class="c5 c3">ML Phase II: Feature Engineering: </span></h5><ul class="c7 lst-kix_1oaw0j5464g-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #16:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Plan to launch and iterate.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We are building a system which will simplify incorporating new changes and model tuning that may arise as a future requirement for improvising our machine learning solution.</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_qeaix6ys7wx9-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #33:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;If you produce a model based on the data until January 5th, test the model on the data from January 6th and after.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span class="c2">To make sure to better understand the performance of the developed machine learning model, we will use this approach of testing the model on data with dates after the date in the training data.</span></p><h5 class="c6" id="h.a1a5eu59xm1x"><span class="c3 c5">ML Phase III: Slowed Growth, Optimization Refinement, and Complex Models:</span></h5><ul class="c7 lst-kix_kxo93qt4ycvo-0 start"><li class="c0"><span class="c3">Rule #40:</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Keep ensembles simple.</span></li></ul><p class="c1"><span>We are planning to implement predictions with the ensemble of basic linear regression models by making sure the increase in predicted probability of the underlying classifier does not decrease the predicted probability of ensembles.</span></p></body>
